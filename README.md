# Matka's Marvels - 2018
A small shop for my mother's crafts. She makes beautiful hand crafted quilts that she wanted a place to show them off to people who might be wanting to buy them. 
Utilizing paypal.me to pay for items, obviously not ideal but my mom didn't want to mess with shopify or anything like that, so manual process it is.
